This repo houses an exhibition of the skills I acquired via Adrian Rosebrock's book entitled "Deep Learning for Computer Vision".

Adrian can be found at: https://www.pyimagesearch.com/ .

His book, "Deep Learning for Computer Vision" can be found at: https://www.pyimagesearch.com/deep-learning-computer-vision-python-book/ .

I highly recommend any and all of Adrian's books for those new in the field or wanting to delve deeper and have a better understanding of the concepts.
